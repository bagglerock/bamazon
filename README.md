Node.js & MySQL Homework


In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

Installation Instructions:

- Clone this repo
- NPM install
- Start MySQL
- In your MySQL database, copy and run the schema.sql to make and populate the database with test items.
